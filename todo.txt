- email mingxiao about how long 1 second would be (what is the sample length?) 
- include frontal electrodes (FP1 and FP2)?
- note that the formatting for our datasets are different

- divide everything in the resting dataset by 10^6?
- also transpose the resting dataset and cut out the non electrode columns to match our data
